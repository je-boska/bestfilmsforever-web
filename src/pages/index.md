â€‹Our production services range from full-scale live broadcast video productions to independent consultations for tech solutions on live streams. On the creative end, we make music videos, short-form documentaries, cultural archive pieces, and commissioned visual content. All of our content is to fulfill self-publication.

We work with artists, festivals, creative agencies, cultural institutions, and brands who are craving to think outside of the box. We are about pitching and promoting women in tech.

In the end, we aim to collaborate with creative communities who want to further develop visual projects and provide an archive of the ongoing cultural movement into the virtual.
